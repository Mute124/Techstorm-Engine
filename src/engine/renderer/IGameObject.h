	/// You may implement this yourself to create your own game objects and drawing code, or you can inherit from <see cref="Techstorm::GameObject" /> to use the default
	/// implementation. However, if you inherit from this class, be sure you have a basic understanding of Raylib's and OpenGL's rendering system. If not,
	/// see <see cref="https://learnopengl.com/"/> and <see cref="https://www.raylib.com/"/> for a good place to start. In addition, it is not advised for you to inherit this
	/// yourself because it will require you to implement rendering code. However, it is recommended if your game requires a rendering system that is not provided by default.
